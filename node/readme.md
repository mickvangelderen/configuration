For Ubuntu, run the [install script](ubuntu/install.sh) as super user.

For Windows, install [nvm](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases).

 > Note: I had to remove the *user* environment variables NVM_HOME and NVM_SYMLINK manually. They prevented the PATH variable from expanding the *system* environment variables NVM_HOME and NVM_SYMLINK.
