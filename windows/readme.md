# Install

The install script adds the bin folders and bash scripts. I recommend installing (Git for Windows)[https://git-for-windows.github.io/] and (Console Z)[https://github.com/cbucher/console] to get a working bash environment in a nice looking terminal. 

# Registry

## mouse-fixed.reg

Disables mouse acceleration in Windows.

## no-lock-screen.reg

Disables lock screen on Windows 10.
